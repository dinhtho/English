for me smart living means has to start
00:20
with being productive how many of you
00:23
would like to be more productive okay if
00:26
you are a student you would like to get
00:29
better grades without having to work
00:31
harder if you have a job you want to be
00:35
more productive in your work you want to
00:37
gain more recognition for your work
00:40
without having to put more hours because
00:43
everyone has the same 24 hours a day and
00:45
there are many ways to be more
00:47
productive but the one way that I'm
00:51
going to talk about in my session is how
00:54
you can improve your focus and how you
00:56
can improve your attention and what the
00:58
psychology and neuroscience have to say
01:00
to improve your focus and attention the
01:05
big challenge that faces all of us
01:06
especially in modern society is that
01:09
there's too much information it's both a
01:13
blessing but also a curse that we have
01:17
access to infinite amounts of
01:19
information all the knowledge that has
01:21
been produced by humankind is at the end
01:23
of your thumbs just by opening up your
01:25
phone and again it's a huge privilege
01:28
and we're very lucky to be in this kind
01:31
of era but on the other hand just it's
01:35
very hard to choose and it's very hard
01:36
to decide where to start because we are
01:39
constantly confronted with too much
01:41
information secondly we also distract
01:46
ourselves it's hard to focus on our own
01:48
one good example is that you commonly
01:51
see people walking down the street with
01:53
their eyes glued to their phone and of
01:56
course they're somewhat oblivious to
01:59
their surroundings sorry can have my
02:01
videos please please coming to the door
02:04
and boom he just hits the door walks
02:06
right into it
02:08
and the next video is a woman walking in
02:11
a mall checking out our cell phone and
02:13
you can see that she falls straight into
02:15
that fountain okay so you know we
02:20
distract ourselves all the time
02:22
making us oblivious to our surroundings
02:24
these are comical examples but of course
02:27
there are more serious dangerous
02:28
examples for instance if you're driving
02:32
a train and engineer driving a train and
02:34
you lose your focus for even just a few
02:37
seconds then if you don't slow down your
02:39
speed your train is going to run off the
02:40
tracks - very dangerous effect so these
02:45
are just a few examples how we are just
02:47
overloaded with information and how we
02:50
distract ourselves and so the question
02:52
is how can we improve our focus we are
02:55
living in what John Cassidy of the New
02:57
York New Yorker magazine calls the
03:00
attention deficit disorder economy or
03:03
the attention deficit disorder society
03:06
and the consequences of that we're still
03:08
trying to understand we know that it
03:12
means that we're little less focused
03:14
more distracted we may be more shallow
03:16
this overwhelming information may make
03:20
us less productive and as I just pointed
03:24
out over here it can also lead to
03:26
dangerous situations the economic cost
03:29
of attention deficits has been estimated
03:32
to be even up to about 200 billion
03:34
dollars in the United States alone these
03:37
are serious problems that affect our
03:39
productivity so here's an example I want
03:44
to see how well you can attend at the
03:47
beginning of my talk this is a video and
03:50
your task is to focus on the team with
03:52
white clothes and ignore the team with
03:55
black clothes okay they're going to run
03:57
around the screen and your task is to
04:00
count how many times are passing the
04:01
ball to other players on the screen
04:03
other white players white t-shirt
04:06
players on the screen okay count it
04:07
quietly in your head and then at the end
04:09
I'm going to ask you to yell out the
04:11
answer so count how many times the white
04:13
t-shirt team passes the ball to other
04:15
players on its team and it's important
04:18
to do this as quietly as possible don't
04:20
F don't don't call or talk because
04:23
that's going to hurt other people's
04:24
concentration okay so here's our first
04:27
attention-deficit test here we go one
04:30
two three how many passes does the team
04:34
in white make
04:51
okay what was the answer how many times
04:53
yell it up 1313 excellent you guys have
04:56
great attention that's that's really
04:58
fantastic we're off to a good start now
05:00
some of you may have seen this video
05:02
because it's on YouTube and it's a
05:03
pretty well-known one but if you've
05:05
never seen this video before please
05:06
raise your hands up high as high as you
05:08
can okay look around there's most of you
05:10
have not seen this video keep your hands
05:11
up high please now there was actually
05:13
something else going on in this video
05:15
and you can lower your hand keep your
05:18
hands up please
05:18
keep your hands up you can lower your
05:20
hand if you saw a dancing bear but if
05:24
you did not see the dancing bear keep
05:25
your hands up look around you're not
05:27
alone most of you have missed a very
05:29
critical part of this video okay so now
05:32
you can lower your hand you're not alone
05:34
let's watch the video again no counting
05:36
just watch the video now okay now no
05:40
countess's does the team in white mic
05:42
and just watch as you were monitoring
05:45
the white t-shirt team on the on the
05:49
right this guy in a bear suit comes out
05:51
as I was trying to dance right and the
05:54
moon walks out and a good majority of
05:57
you the very smart group of people
05:59
totally missed this very obvious feature
06:02
of the video okay on the one hand that
06:06
means that your attention is really good
06:07
because you did not you know see
06:09
something that I didn't ask you to look
06:11
for but on the other hand it really
06:13
highlights how limited your ability to
06:16
see the world and to experience the
06:18
world is our brains are limited and
06:20
that's the point I'm trying to make with
06:22
this video
06:23
in fact we study this in my own
06:26
laboratory at Yale in collaboration with
06:29
one of my former postdoc students
06:31
Yatta Zoo who's now a professor at
06:33
Harvard University we conducted this
06:35
study where we asked people to do
06:36
something very simple just look at these
06:39
shapes shown there on the left and we
06:42
asked them to attend to the shapes and
06:44
try to remember them for like two
06:46
seconds and sometimes they have to
06:48
remember one sometimes they have to
06:50
remember two sometimes they have to
06:51
remember three very simple tasks people
06:54
have no trouble attending to and
06:57
remembering one of the objects okay
06:59
and we also measured what their brains
07:01
are doing while they're looking at this
07:03
asked and doing this task and that line
07:06
on the bottom with the light green shows
07:08
what happens when people are attending
07:10
to and remembering just one item the
07:13
brain doesn't have to work too hard and
07:15
people do super well they're almost
07:17
perfect in the task but once you
07:20
increase it to two items or three items
07:22
you can see in the darker lines on the
07:26
graph your brain has to work harder and
07:28
not only does your brain have to work
07:30
harder the performance drops people
07:33
start making mistakes even for something
07:35
this simple basically your brain can
07:40
handle only one thing at a time only one
07:43
thing well at a time yes you can you can
07:46
try to remember two things or three
07:47
things you're capable of doing it but
07:49
your productivity your performance is
07:51
going to start to go down so let's do
07:56
one more another attention test just in
07:58
case you missed the the bear try doing
08:00
this one just listen to this nice video
08:03
again it's actually a commercial
08:05
advertisement for a car but I think it
08:08
makes good use of psychology and
08:09
cognitive science so I'll let it speak
08:12
for itself I I don't receive any
08:14
endorsements from this company but here
08:16
we go
08:20
to test just how much attention the
08:23
attention stealing design of the new
08:25
Skoda Fabia actually steals we left one
08:28
parked on this ordinary road in West
08:29
London we wanted to see if it's sharp
08:32
crystalline shapes bold lines and lower
08:35
wider profile would attract the desired
08:37
level of attention will the 17-inch
08:41
black alloy wheels stop passers-by in
08:43
their tracks will the angular headlights
08:46
attract the attention of other road
08:47
users will a crowd gather to check out
08:51
it's fresh sporty look well not quite
08:57
but did the attention ceiling design
09:00
distract you from noticing that the
09:02
entire Street has been changing right
09:04
before your very eyes don't believe us
09:07
have another look did you spot the van
09:11
changing to a taxi how about the scooter
09:14
changing to a pair of bicycles or the
09:17
lady holding a pig let alone the fact
09:20
that the entire street is now completely
09:22
different didn't think so okay so
09:26
hopefully I've made the point that your
09:29
brain can really only attend to focus on
09:32
do well one thing at a time one object
09:34
at a time one task at a time and so with
09:38
that background I'm now going to share
09:40
three tips on how to improve your focus
09:43
and attention given these limitations
09:46
tip number one is to try to simplify
09:50
what you attend to okay and I'll explain
09:55
that more in a moment because first we
09:58
have to try to understand why is it the
10:00
case that the brain can only attend to
10:02
one thing at a time I would like for you
10:05
to think of your brain as an orchestra
10:07
okay it's like an orchestra you don't
10:09
just when you listen to an orchestra you
10:11
don't just focus on one instrument or
10:14
one player you listen to the whole
10:16
harmony of all the different instruments
10:19
coming in and out there's beautiful
10:21
music comes from the synchrony and
10:23
harmony and coordination of all the
10:25
different instrument pieces and that's
10:27
exactly how the brain works as well and
10:29
right now again in my laboratory we are
10:32
working on ways to
10:33
this harmony and to quantify this
10:35
harmony using something called
10:37
functional connectivity and we can build
10:39
models of how well people attend based
10:44
on this harmony such that what you have
10:47
here on this graph over here on the
10:48
x-axis is a prediction of who's more
10:51
attentive and who's less attentive and
10:54
what we have on the y-axis is actual
10:57
individuals that were predicting and you
10:59
can see that our models do a good job if
11:01
you listen to the entire brain you can
11:03
predict who is going to be more
11:04
attentive and who's going to be less
11:06
attentive in fact these graphs allow us
11:08
to even predict symptoms for attentional
11:10
deficit disorders so clearly people
11:14
differ ok I told you that you're all
11:16
limited to only attend to one thing so
11:18
people but still different people some
11:21
people are more focused than other
11:22
people the people on the top right are
11:24
more focused and can hold their
11:26
attention for a longer time than people
11:28
on the bottom left so what is different
11:30
about all of your brains and how can we
11:33
help you have the kind of brain that's
11:35
on the top right that allows you to
11:37
maintain focus so my three tips as I
11:40
mentioned my first tip is simplify I
11:43
told you that there's too much
11:45
information in the environment then
11:47
control how much information is that you
11:50
have to pay attention to if you're a
11:52
company trying to sell a product or to
11:54
teach something or to introduce
11:56
something to another person simplify
11:58
your message and likewise as a consumer
12:01
simplify what you see my favorite
12:04
example is this you know legendary
12:07
introduction of the iPhone by the past
12:10
of Steve Jobs the phone design speaks
12:14
for itself
12:14
he puts the price up he puts up the size
12:17
of the memory and just leaves it to the
12:19
bare essentials so that people can focus
12:21
on the important information if he were
12:24
an amateur presenter he might have
12:26
presented a slide like this ok
12:28
introducing the new iPhone revolutionary
12:30
design but this and this is how some
12:32
people make their slides
12:33
it's how some companies sell their
12:35
products but really you have to simplify
12:37
because consumers all of us we don't
12:41
have the capacity to process so much
12:43
information
12:46
tip number two is to relax okay it's so
12:50
important this is a very famous old
12:55
principle in psychology called the
12:59
York's toxin curve and what we have here
13:01
on the x-axis is arousal okay or stress
13:05
or emotion it or focus I tell it's all
13:11
of that on the bottom axis from low to
13:14
high and then of course what we care
13:16
about is the y-axis performance okay we
13:19
want to be high so high performance some
13:22
people act as if the harder they folk
13:24
you know the more pumped up they are and
13:26
the harder they try that performance is
13:28
always going to go up okay the more
13:31
stressed you get the performance will go
13:33
up some people think that but of course
13:36
a research indicates that that's not the
13:38
case the curve is actually a u-shaped
13:41
upside-down U shaped function so that
13:45
optimal performance yes you need some
13:47
arousal you need to put some effort into
13:50
any task and then you hit your peak
13:52
performance but if you put too much
13:54
effort in or you're over aroused then
13:57
your performance is going to drop over
13:59
on the far right so that's very
14:02
important principle in attention
14:04
research so how do you relax of course
14:07
that's a whole other TED talk on how to
14:09
relax I'm just going to share two quick
14:12
sub tips for that one is to don't forget
14:15
to breathe as you know as as basic as
14:19
that sounds but if you're feeling
14:21
stressed or even if you're not feeling
14:22
stressed it's really good to breathe so
14:25
let's try it once here we're going to
14:27
take a deep breath in for about five to
14:29
ten seconds this breathe in make the air
14:32
come all the way down to the bottom of
14:34
your lungs and then exhale very slowly
14:37
okay very good don't just catch it fear
14:40
that the clarity in your brain happening
14:42
when you do that it makes two points
14:45
when you engage in deep breathing it
14:49
will actually help you relax and another
14:51
point is that in order to breathe deeply
14:53
you actually have to relax no one's
14:56
going to do this deep breath while
14:57
they're jumping up and
14:58
or doing some kind of weird exercise and
15:01
so that's what I think one reason one
15:03
very simple and free tip you can have to
15:06
try to help relaxing meditation prayer
15:09
yoga there are many other ways to relax
15:12
as well the second thing I'll share on
15:13
the topic of relaxation is maybe a
15:17
surprising one or maybe it's not but
15:20
exercise is really great and taking
15:22
walks is huge there's actually a ton of
15:25
research showing that taking a walk is
15:28
very beneficial not only for your mood
15:30
but also for your attention for your
15:32
cognitive skills and importantly it's
15:35
important to take a walk in a park or a
15:38
place where there are trees where
15:39
there's greenery where there's a green
15:41
environment so about if you take two
15:44
groups and this is work done by Berman
15:46
and Janee teas at the University of
15:47
Michigan if you take two groups compare
15:50
walking in the city versus walking in a
15:52
park or walking in a forest people who
15:55
walk in a forest are not only more
15:57
relaxed and happier but they actually
15:59
show improved attention and focus after
16:02
they return from their walk okay so just
16:05
a little plug for taking a walk after
16:08
lunch my final tip is uni-tasking and
16:12
this is probably the most important tip
16:14
I want to share with you because I think
16:16
there's a ton of research that is
16:18
counterintuitive to people people saying
16:20
in order to be productive I need to
16:21
multitask I need to do more things at
16:24
any given time but that's actually
16:26
opposite to everything I just told you
16:28
about how the brain works your brain
16:30
works better when it's uni-tasking when
16:33
it's only doing one thing at a time okay
16:34
how many of you check your phones when
16:38
you're studying or when you're doing
16:39
something important like writing a
16:41
report or making an important plan for
16:43
your job how many check your phones
16:44
check your messages when you do that
16:46
come on let's be honest okay everyone
16:48
checks your phones right
16:49
how many check your phones more than
16:50
like one or two times an hour okay yes
16:53
all your hands are still up okay
16:55
psychology and neuroscience research
16:57
suggests that that's not a very
16:59
efficient way to work so let's try this
17:02
out I think this is important
17:03
demonstration I'm going to show a list
17:06
of numbers on the left if the number is
17:09
ooh at 7:00 if the number is pink
17:11
subtract 7 and then move on to the next
17:14
number you're going down the list as
17:15
fast as you can add 7 if it's blue and
17:18
just subtract 7 if it's red and move on
17:20
to the next number when you're done just
17:22
clap your hands so I know when people
17:23
are finished okay clear instructions add
17:25
7 or subtract them and here we go 1 2 3
17:30
and do it as fast as you can
17:43
okay I'm hearing some claps when you're
17:45
done just clap your hand quickly okay
17:50
great so you know you're pretty much
17:51
done okay let's just do it one more time
17:52
okay now the list on the on the right
17:55
here we go if it's blue add seven if
18:01
it's pink subtract seven fast as you can
18:06
and then you can clap at the end of the
18:09
list
18:19
okay so what do you think I'll just know
18:23
much harder isn't it it's much harder
18:26
but you probably also noticed that these
18:29
two lists are the same okay the same
18:31
number of addition problems the same
18:33
number of subtraction problems but on
18:36
the left your unit tasking doing a bunch
18:38
of addition and then only switching once
18:40
to do subtraction on the right you're
18:43
multitasking okay so when you're
18:45
studying or working while checking your
18:46
phone you're doing stuff on the right
18:48
you're making a job harder for yourself
18:50
and if you to test this in the
18:53
laboratory on the right you're going to
18:55
be 30% slower and you're going to be 30%
18:59
less accurate and your brain has to work
19:01
harder it's like exercising wearing a
19:04
big heavy backpack why would you
19:06
handicap yourself if you can uni tasks
19:09
like we showed you here on the left okay
19:12
so that's my final tip is to try to uni
19:15
tasks to improve your focus and
19:17
productivity it's okay to check your
19:19
phone just do it after you finish
19:20
working for thirty minutes or an hour
19:23
as a reward don't check it every five
19:25
minutes don't check your email every
19:27
five minutes don't check your Facebook
19:29
every five minutes
19:30
so in conclusion again my three tips for
19:33
improving focus and attention are
19:35
simplify relax you need tasks I
19:38
guarantee that the research indicates
19:40
that your productivity will go up if you
19:43
follow these tips and it may even make
19:45
you smarter thank you very much
19:49
you
