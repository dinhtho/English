So, I have a Facebook friend whose life seems perfect.
00:09
She lives in a gorgeous house.
00:11
And she has a really rewarding career.
00:14
And she and her family go
00:15
on all these exciting adventures together on the weekends.
00:19
And I swear that they must take
00:20
a professional photographer along with them,
00:22
(Laughter)
00:24
because no matter where they go or what they do,
00:26
the whole family just looks beautiful.
00:29
And she's always posting about how blessed she is,
00:33
and how grateful she is for the life that she has.
00:36
And I get the feeling that she's not just saying those things
00:39
for the sake of Facebook, but she truly means it.
00:43
How many of you have a friend kind of like that?
00:48
And how many of you
00:50
kind of don't like that person sometimes?
00:53
(Laughter)
00:56
We all do this, right?
00:58
It's hard not to do.
01:00
But that way of thinking costs us something.
01:04
And that's what I want to talk to you about today--
01:06
is what our bad habits cost us.
01:10
Maybe you've scrolled through your Facebook feed
01:13
and you think, "So what if I roll my eyes?
01:15
It's just five seconds of my time.
01:18
How could it be hurting me?"
01:20
Well, researchers have found
01:22
that envying your friends on Facebook,
01:25
actually leads to depression.
01:28
That's just one of the traps that our minds can set for us.
01:32
Have you ever complained about your boss?
01:35
Or looked at your friends' lives and thought,
01:37
"Why do they have all the luck?"
01:40
You can't help thinking that way, right?
01:43
That way of thinking seems small in the moment.
01:45
In fact, it might even make you feel better in the moment.
01:49
But that way of thinking is eating away at your mental strength.
01:55
There's three kinds of destructive beliefs
01:57
that make us less effective,
01:59
and rob us of our mental strength.
02:03
The first one is unhealthy beliefs about ourselves.
02:07
We tend to feel sorry for ourselves.
02:10
And while it's OK to be sad when something bad happens,
02:14
self-pity goes beyond that.
02:16
It's when you start to magnify your misfortune.
02:19
When you think things like,
02:20
"Why do these things always have to happen to me?"
02:23
"I shouldn't have to deal with it."
02:25
That way of thinking keeps you stuck,
02:27
keeps you focused on the problem,
02:29
keeps you from finding a solution.
02:33
And even when you can't create a solution,
02:35
you can always take steps to make your life or somebody else's life better.
02:39
But you can't do that
02:40
when you're busy hosting your own pity party.
02:45
The second type of destructive belief that holds us back
02:48
is unhealthy beliefs about others.
02:52
We think that other people can control us,
02:54
and we give away our power.
02:57
But as adults who live in a free country,
03:00
there's very few things in life that you have to do.
03:04
So when you say, "I have to work late,"
03:07
you give away your power.
03:09
Yeah, maybe there will be consequences if you don't work late,
03:12
but it's still a choice.
03:15
Or when you say, "My mother-in-law drives me crazy,"
03:19
you give away your power.
03:22
Maybe she's not the nicest person on earth,
03:25
but it's up to you how you respond to her,
03:27
because you're in control.
03:31
The third type of unhealthy belief that holds us back,
03:35
is unhealthy beliefs about the world.
03:38
We tend to think that the world owes us something.
03:41
We think, "If I put in enough hard work,
03:44
then I deserve success."
03:47
But expecting success to fall into your lap
03:49
like some sort of cosmic reward,
03:52
will only lead to disappointment.
03:56
But I know it's hard to give up our bad mental habits.
03:59
It's hard to get rid of those unhealthy beliefs
04:01
that we've carried around with us for so long.
04:04
But you can't afford not to give them up.
04:07
Because sooner or later, you're going to hit a time in your life
04:11
where you need all the mental strength that you can muster.
04:16
When I was 23 years old,
04:19
I thought I had life all figured out.
04:23
I graduated from grad school.
04:25
I landed my first big job as a therapist.
04:28
I got married.
04:29
And I even bought a house.
04:31
And I thought, "This is going to be great!"
04:33
"I've got this incredible jump start on success."
04:36
What could go wrong?
04:39
That all changed for me one day
04:41
when I got a phone call from my sister.
04:44
She said that our mother was found unresponsive
04:47
and she'd been taken to the hospital.
04:50
My husband Lincoln and I jumped in the car and rushed to the hospital.
04:54
We couldn't imagine what could be wrong.
04:57
My mother was only 51.
04:59
She didn't have any history of any kind of health problems.
05:04
When we got to the hospital,
05:05
doctors explained she'd had a brain aneurysm.
05:10
And within 24 hours, my mother,
05:13
who used to wake up in the morning saying, "It's a great day to be alive,"
05:17
passed away.
05:19
That news was devastating to me.
05:21
My mother and I had been very close.
05:23
As a therapist, I knew on an intellectual level how to go through grief.
05:28
But knowing it, and doing it, can be two very different things.
05:32
It took a long time before I felt like I was really healing.
05:38
And then on the three year anniversary of my mother's death,
05:42
some friends called,
05:44
and invited Lincoln and me to a basketball game.
05:48
Coincidentally, it was being played
05:50
at the same auditorium where I'd last seen my mother,
05:54
on the night before she'd passed away.
05:57
I hadn't been back there since.
05:59
I wasn't even sure I wanted to go back.
06:01
But Lincoln and I talked about it, and ultimately we said,
06:05
"Maybe that would be a good way to honor her memory."
06:08
So we went to the game.
06:10
And we actually had a really good time with our friends.
06:13
On the drive home that night,
06:15
we talked about how great it was
06:16
to finally be able to go back to that place,
06:19
and remember my mother with a smile,
06:21
rather than all those feelings of sadness.
06:25
But shortly after we got home that night, Lincoln said he didn't feel well.
06:31
A few minutes later, he collapsed.
06:34
I had to call for an ambulance.
06:37
His family met me at the emergency room.
06:40
We waited for what seemed like forever,
06:43
until finally a doctor came out.
06:46
But rather than taking us out back to see Lincoln,
06:49
he took us back to a private room,
06:53
and sat us down,
06:55
and explained to us that Lincoln,
06:57
who was the most adventurous person I'd ever met,
06:59
was gone.
07:03
We didn't know at the time, but he'd had a heart attack.
07:06
He was only 26.
07:08
He didn't have any history of heart problems.
07:14
So now I found myself a 26-year-old widow,
07:17
and I didn't have my mom.
07:19
I thought, "How am I going to get through this/"
07:22
And to describe that as a painful period in my life
07:25
feels like an understatement.
07:27
And it was during that time that I realized
07:29
when you're really going through tough times,
07:31
good habits aren't enough.
07:34
It only takes one or two small habits
07:37
to really hold you back.
07:40
I worked as hard as I could,
07:41
not just to create good habits in my life,
07:44
but to get rid of those small habits,
07:46
no matter how small they might seem.
07:49
Throughout it all,
07:50
I held out hope that someday life could get better.
07:54
And eventually it did.
07:57
A few years down the road, I met Steve.
07:59
And we fell in love.
08:01
And I got remarried.
08:03
We sold the house that Lincoln and I had lived in,
08:05
and we bought a new house, in a new area,
08:09
and I got a new job.
08:12
But almost as quickly as I breathed my sigh of relief
08:15
over that fresh start that I had,
08:17
we got the news that Steve's dad had terminal cancer.
08:22
And I started to think,
08:24
"Why do these things always have to keep happening?"
08:26
"Why do I have to keep losing all my loved ones?"
08:29
"This isn't fair."
08:33
But if I'd learned anything,
08:34
it was that that way of thinking would hold me back.
08:39
I knew I was going to need
08:41
as much mental strength as I could muster,
08:43
to get through one more loss.
08:46
So I sat down and I wrote a list
08:48
of all the things mentally strong people don't do.
08:52
And I read over that list.
08:54
It was a reminder of all of those bad habits
08:56
that I'd done at one time or another, that would keep me stuck.
09:01
And I kept reading that list over and over.
09:03
And I really needed it.
09:05
Because within a few weeks of writing it,
09:07
Steve's dad passed away.
09:12
My journey taught me that the secret to being mentally strong,
09:17
was that you had to give up your bad mental habits.
09:21
Mental strength is a lot like physical strength.
09:24
If you wanted to be physically strong,
09:26
you'd need to go to the gym and lift weights.
09:29
But if you really wanted to see results,
09:31
you'd also have to give up eating junk food.
09:35
Mental strength is the same.
09:36
If you want to be mentally strong,
09:38
you need good habits like practicing gratitude.
09:41
But you also have to give up bad habits,
09:43
like resenting somebody else's success.
09:47
No matter how often that happens,
09:49
it will hold you back.
09:53
So, how do you train your brain to think differently?
09:57
How do you give up those bad mental habits
10:00
that you've carried around with you?
10:03
It starts by countering those unhealthy beliefs that I talked about,
10:07
with healthier ones.
10:10
For example, unhealthy beliefs about ourselves
10:13
mostly come about because we're uncomfortable with our feelings.
10:17
Feeling sad, or hurt, or angry, or scared,
10:19
those things are all uncomfortable.
10:22
So we go to great lengths to avoid that discomfort.
10:25
We try to escape it
10:28
by doing things like hosting a pity party.
10:31
And although that's a temporary distraction,
10:34
it just prolongs the pain.
10:36
The only way to get through uncomfortable emotions,
10:39
the only way to deal with them, is you have to go through them.
10:42
To let yourself feel sad, and then move on.
10:46
To gain confidence in your ability
10:47
to deal with that discomfort.
10:51
Unhealthy beliefs about others come about
10:54
because we compare ourselves to other people.
10:57
We think that they're either above us or below us.
11:00
Or we think that they can control how we feel.
11:02
Or that we can control how they behave.
11:05
Or we blame them for holding us back.
11:07
But really, it's our own choices that do that.
11:11
You have to accept that you're your own person,
11:13
and other people are separate from you.
11:16
The only person you should compare yourself to,
11:18
is the person that you were yesterday.
11:22
And unhealthy beliefs about the world come about
11:25
because deep down, we want the world to be fair.
11:29
We want to think that if we put in enough good deeds,
11:32
enough good things will happen to us.
11:34
Or if we tough it out through enough bad times,
11:37
we'll get some sort of reward.
11:40
But ultimately you have to accept that life isn't fair.
11:44
And that can be liberating.
11:46
Yeah, it means you won't necessarily be rewarded for your goodness,
11:50
but it also means no matter how much you've suffered,
11:52
you're not doomed to keep suffering.
11:56
The world doesn't work that way.
11:59
Your world is what you make it.
12:02
But of course before you can change your world,
12:05
you have to believe that you can change it.
12:08
I once worked with this man who had been diabetic for years.
12:13
His doctor referred him to therapy
12:15
because he had some bad mental habits
12:17
that were starting to affect his physical health.
12:21
His mother had died from complications of diabetes at a young age,
12:25
so he just believed he was doomed,
12:27
and he'd given up trying to manage his blood sugar altogether.
12:31
In fact, his blood sugar had gotten so high lately,
12:34
that it was starting to affect his vision.
12:37
And he had his driver's license taken away.
12:40
And his world was shrinking.
12:44
When he came into my office, it was clear
12:46
he knew all the things he could do to manage his blood sugar.
12:50
He just didn't think it was worth the effort.
12:54
But eventually, he agreed to make one small change.
12:58
He said, "I'll give up my two liter-a-day Pepsi habit,
13:02
and I'll trade it in for Diet Pepsi."
13:05
And he couldn't believe how quickly his numbers started to improve.
13:10
And even though he came every week
13:12
to remind me how horrible Diet Pepsi tasted,
13:16
he stuck with it.
13:19
And once he started to see a little bit of improvement,
13:22
he said, "Well, maybe I could look at some of my other habits."
13:25
He said, "I could trade in my nightly bowl of ice cream
13:28
for a snack with a little less sugar."
13:32
And then one day he was at a thrift store with some friends,
13:35
and he found this beat-up old exercise bike.
13:38
He bought it for a couple of bucks,
13:40
and he brought it home, and he parked it in front of his TV.
13:44
And he started to pedal
13:45
while he'd watch some of his favorite shows every night.
13:49
And not only did he lose weight,
13:51
but one day, he noticed he could see the TV
13:55
just a little bit more clearly than he had before.
13:59
And suddenly it occurred to him,
14:01
maybe the damage done to his eyesight wasn't permanent.
14:06
So he set a new goal for himself--
14:08
to get his driver's license back.
14:11
And from that day forward, he was on fire.
14:14
By the end of our time together, he was coming in every week
14:17
saying, "OK, what are we going to do this week?"
14:21
Because he finally believed that he could change his world.
14:24
And that he had the mental strength to change it.
14:27
And that he could give up his bad mental habits.
14:30
And it all started with just one small step.
14:35
So I invite you to consider
14:37
what bad mental habits are holding you back?
14:41
What unhealthy beliefs
14:43
are keeping you from being as mentally strong as you could be?
14:47
And what is one small step that you could take today?
14:51
Right here, right now.
14:54
Thank you.
14:55
(Applause)
