In my past life as a soccer coach,
00:08
once you won a national championship,
00:10
everyone wants to come play for you.
00:12
Really not true.
00:13
Once you paid them $ 25,000 a year in scholarships,
00:17
everybody wants to come play for you.
00:18
And parents would always come to me and they'd say:
00:20
"Okay, my son or my daughter wants to come play at your university,
00:24
what is it that we have to do?
00:26
You know, what are you looking for?"
00:27
And being the Socratic professor that I am,
00:29
I say, well, what does your son or daughter do?
00:31
What do they do really well that we'd be interested in?
00:33
And typically their answers are, well, they've got great vision.
00:36
They're really good.
00:37
They can see the entire field.
00:39
Or, my daughter is the fastest player, there's nobody that can beat her.
00:42
Or, my son's got a great left-footer.
00:45
Really great in the air and can hit every ball.
00:47
I'm like: "Yeah, not bad;
00:50
but to be quite honest with you,
00:52
those are the last things I'm looking for.
00:54
The most important thing?
00:57
Self-confidence."
00:58
Without that skill, and I use the word skill intentionally,
01:01
without that skill, we are useless as a soccer player.
01:06
Because when you lose sight or belief in yourself,
01:09
we're done for.
01:11
I use the definition of self-confidence
01:13
to be the ability or the belief
01:16
to believe in yourself, to accomplish any task,
01:20
no matter the odds, no matter the difficulty,
01:23
no matter the adversity.
01:24
The belief that you can accomplished it, self-confidence.
01:28
Some of you are saying, "Great, I don't have it. I'm so shy.
01:31
I'll never do that, bla, bla, bla."
01:33
And you start to drag all the way down here.
01:37
But, I use the word skill
01:39
because
01:40
I believe it can be trained.
01:41
And I'll show you a couple of ways in which we do.
01:44
Hopefully I won't run out of time.
01:45
I don't use any slides
01:46
because my speech always goes here, or here, or here.
01:48
So we'll see which way we get to.
01:50
The easiest way to build self-confidence:
01:53
there's no magic button.
01:54
I can't say: "Hey, this plane is going down,
01:56
who can fly?
01:56
Put your hand up."
01:57
"I can, I'm confident!"
01:59
(Laughter)
02:01
Repetition, repetition, repetition.
02:05
Right?
02:06
What does Malcom Gladwell call it, the 10,000-hour rule?
02:09
There's no magic button.
02:10
I recruited a goalie from Colombia, South America one year.
02:13
Big, tall 6'3" man.
02:15
You know, he had hands like stone.
02:18
I thought he was like Flipper.
02:19
Everytime I threw him the ball, down, onto the ground.
02:22
I was like, oh my god, we're in trouble.
02:24
Simple solution: get to the wall,
02:26
kick a ball against the wall and catch it.
02:28
kick the ball against the wall and catch it.
02:30
His goal was 350 a day for eight months.
02:33
He came back, his hands were calloused,
02:36
the moisture on his hands were literally gone,
02:38
he is now playing in Europe.
02:40
Magic? No.
02:41
Repetition, repetition, repetition.
02:44
The problem is, we expect to be self-confident
02:47
but we can't be unless the skill,
02:49
or the task we're doing,
02:51
is not novel, is not new to us.
02:53
We want to be in a situation
02:55
where we have so much pressure in that
02:58
and what I mean, cause pressure builds diamonds,
03:00
we want to be in a situation where
03:02
"hey, I've done this a thousand times".
03:04
I did my speech,
03:06
and I practiced in front of a mirror: bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla.
03:08
Hey I'm sounding good.
03:09
And then I went in front of my kids, and my wife.
03:12
I said, oh gosh, I got a little nervous.
03:14
Then I'd get in front of Glenn Gould,
03:15
Oh my goodness, I am a little more nervous!
03:17
By the time I get to the ACG,
03:19
where 2,500 people, can't say anymore, right?
03:22
Twenty-five hundred people,
03:24
where twenty-five hundred people are there,
03:26
I won't have a single ounce of nervousness
03:29
because of my ability to practice.
03:32
Right?
03:33
Over, and over, and over, again.
03:34
The problem with repetition is:
03:36
how many of us bail after the first bit of failure?
03:40
How many of us bail after the first bit of adversity?
03:43
Edison was on that video,
03:44
and it depends who you ask,
03:46
there's anywhere from 1,000
03:47
to 10,000 tries to build that light bulb.
03:50
1,000 to 10,000.
03:52
J.K Rowling should be on that video.
03:54
Do you know how many publishers she took her Harry Potter book to?
03:57
I believe the number was 12 or 13...
03:59
I am pretty confident but after two or three noes
04:02
I'd be like: "damn it!".
04:03
After six or seven, I'm like: "maybe not!"
04:05
Definitely after nine or ten
04:07
I'd be looking to be a soccer coach
04:08
or something else besides an author.
04:09
(Laughter)
04:10
Right?
04:11
I mean, twelve times somebody said no.
04:14
But, practice, practice, practice, and do not accept failure.
04:18
Maybe it shouldn't be repetition,
04:20
maybe the answer should be persistence.
04:22
Because we all repeat something but very few of us really will persist.
04:25
So that's one way to build self-confidence.
04:28
Get out there.
04:30
Do what you want to do and do not accept no.
04:33
The other one is self-talk.
04:34
We all have a self-talk tape that plays in our head.
04:37
Anybody go shopping and put on a pair of pants this week?
04:40
If you're a woman,
04:41
the first thing that always comes:
04:42
"damn I look fat in these pants!."
04:44
And if you're a man, it's the opposite:
04:46
"Oh god, I got no muscle, I'm so flabby!"
04:49
Right? We all have this tape that plays in our head.
04:52
As a student, if they asked me the question,
04:54
it was like: "Oh, gee please professor don't pick me, I don't know the answer."
04:58
I'd look down.
04:59
Right?
05:00
If you're in the b...when I, let me tell you something,
05:02
and the VP of business adminis. here, I shouldn't repeat this,
05:05
but when they hired me as an Athletics director,
05:07
I sat in an architect's meeting,
05:09
and I am as dumb as a post
05:11
when it comes to anything to do with numbers and angles.
05:14
And they are like:
05:15
the fundibulator valve
05:16
of the architectural, uh,
05:18
what do you think doctor Joseph?
05:21
Uh, let me look into that for you and get back to you.
05:23
(Laughter)
05:25
Right?
05:26
I was in a, oh god god, please don't ask me, please don't ask me.
05:30
We all have this negative self-talk that goes in our head.
05:34
Guess what?
05:35
There's enough people that are telling us we can't do it.
05:39
That we're not good enough.
05:40
Why do we want to tell ourselves that?
05:43
We know for a fact that thoughts influence actions.
05:47
We saw it there with the video Sheldon, Dr. Levy showed.
05:51
We know that our thoughts influence actions,
05:53
why do we want to say that negative self-talk to ourselves?
05:56
We need to get our own self-affirmations.
05:59
Muhammad Ali, what was his self-affirmation?
06:02
I am the greatest!
06:06
Who else is going to tell you?
06:08
There need to be quiet moments in your bedroom,
06:10
quiet moments when you're brushing your teeth.
06:12
That we need to reaffirm:
06:14
"I am the captain of my ship and the master of my fate!"
06:18
That is my affirmation.
06:21
I came from a school of one thousand people,
06:23
I lived in a town of one thousand people for fifteen years;
06:26
there's no reason that I should be in charge of an Athletics department,
06:29
building maple leaf gardens.
06:31
But I am the captain of my ship and the master of my fate.
06:35
If I don't say it, if I don't believe it,
06:38
no one else will.
06:40
How do you build self-confidence?
06:43
Get away from the people who will tear you down.
06:46
There's enough of that.
06:47
Muhammad Ali, I am the greatest! There is no one better than me.
06:53
There's a difference between hubris, and ego, and false pride.
06:57
It's just reminding yourself in quiet silent moments,
07:00
I put it down on a list,
07:02
it's right beside my mirror,
07:04
right?
07:05
about all the things that make me who I am.
07:07
Because I make enough mistakes,
07:09
and the newspapers will recognize it,
07:11
and people around me will recognize it;
07:13
and they'll tear me down,
07:14
and pretty soon I'll begin to believe it.
07:17
There was a time when my confidence was really low.
07:20
There was a time when I took this job
07:22
when I came from Iowa,
07:24
I don't know if I could do it.
07:27
I had to bring out my self-confidence letter.
07:29
A letter I wrote to myself when I was feeling good.
07:32
Ivan, congratulations on getting your PhD before 40.
07:36
Congra...I am 40, under.
07:40
(Laughter)
07:41
Congratulations on winning a national championship.
07:44
Good job on raising three good kids and marrying the right woman.
07:48
I wrote a letter to myself,
07:49
it was my own brag sheet.
07:51
My own letter about the things I was proud of.
07:54
Because there are moments,
07:56
and we'll all experience them in our career, in our lives,
08:00
in our job hunting, in our relationships;
08:02
when we are not feeling good about
08:04
who, and what, and where we are.
08:06
And I had to bring out that letter and read it time and time again,
08:09
for a period of about two weeks, to weather me through that storm.
08:14
It was important.
08:16
Stop the self-talk, the negative self-talk.
08:19
If you watch you'll see some athletes that have a little bandage,
08:22
or a little brand around them.
08:25
Lance Armstrong is a perfect one.
08:27
What's his self-affirmation?
08:29
Livestrong isn't a brand, it was to remind him of who he was.
08:32
Live strong. Then it became a brand.
08:36
He would move that from one arm to the next arm,
08:38
when doubt and fear came into his mind.
08:41
Live strong, put it on there, let's go.
08:44
We'll all have it, we place it.
08:48
Two ways to build self-confidence.
08:49
I'm worried about my time
08:50
I'm gonna tell you of one way
08:52
you can build self-confidence in others.
08:54
We are coaches and educators,
08:56
we are teachers, we are people
08:57
who will create value in the world;
08:59
and in doing that, we are critical by the nature of what we do.
09:02
I am a coach, I want you to score a goal.
09:06
The ball went over high. "Dang it!" The ball went high!
09:08
"Thank you coach, I know that. Feedback tells me that."
09:12
So what do we do?
09:13
I need you to put your elbow here,
09:15
I need you to put your knee over the ball,
09:16
I need you to follow through.
09:17
Boom. Land. Great.
09:19
Notice, I never made it as a professional.
09:20
(Laughter)
09:21
What can we do?
09:23
We fix mistakes.
09:24
When I'm fixing that mistake:
09:26
"Johnny, this is terrible,
09:27
you need to bend your knee, you need to do this, this."
09:29
What have I done to Johnny's self-confidence?
09:32
Bend your knee, then do this, then do this.
09:35
Next thing you know, Johnny's crushed.
09:38
Ignore what Johnny does wrong
09:40
and find Bob or Sally or Freda over here.
09:43
Great goal Freda, I love how you kept your knee low,
09:47
you followed through, and you landed like this.
09:50
Great job!
09:51
Johnny: "Oh?"
09:52
Great! Johnny's not demoralized.
09:55
His confidence isn't shot,
09:57
and what I've done is, I've built up Freda's.
10:00
Imagine how we could change the way we parented kids.
10:03
Instead of:
10:04
"get that glass off the counter, what's wrong with you?"
10:06
(Laughter)
10:07
If we catch the mother, good.
10:09
Great job! Great job.
10:12
Thank you Alice for taking your glass to the counter.
10:14
It sounds simple but we forget about it.
10:16
Or as educators, or as somebody as a team,
10:19
if we manage to praise
10:20
the positive behaviour that we wanted to reinforce.
10:24
We forget it. It sounds so simple.
10:26
Catch them when they're good.
10:29
We forget it. It's simple.
10:31
Here's what they did.
10:32
There was a study in Kansas that did this.
10:33
They did video, and we all do video.
10:35
And we show the video of them doing the run of the play:
10:38
"Um, this goal happened because the basket wasn't protected,
10:41
we didn't rotate here, right?
10:43
We needed to do this and then cover the slot."
10:45
And, if that's the baseline,
10:48
improvement of the Kansas State team went like this.
10:51
Then, they said they ignored all of that
10:54
and they just showed them the times they did it right.
10:57
The times they did it perfect.
10:59
That presented no goals, spoke to the same points,
11:01
improvement went like that.
11:04
It changed and revolutionized the way we as coaches
11:07
interact with our student athletes.
11:09
We can apply that to the business world,
11:11
we can apply that to our student group works,
11:13
we can apply that to our management teams.
11:15
Easily: catch them when they are good.
11:19
Last and certainly not least.
11:21
My son is really good at this.
11:24
Self-confident people interpret feedback
11:26
the way they choose to.
11:29
I ask my son who is by the far a terrible, terrible athlete,
11:33
gets it from his dad.
11:34
(Laughter)
11:35
The game's...
11:36
How's the game?
11:37
Oh great! I scored three goals, I got two assists.
11:41
I'm like: "I did not see him touch the puck!"
11:43
But he has his own perception
11:46
of how he did!
11:48
(Laughter)
11:49
I love it!
11:50
(Laughter)
11:51
Right? I'm the...I'm that guy!
11:53
I'm like: "I remember when I was taking
11:55
when I met my wife, it was in the commons.
11:58
"Paulie, would you like to go to the movies?
12:00
Ladies? Tingly, tingly, tingle."
12:02
(Laughter)
12:04
And she goes: "Ah, no."
12:08
I asked her again.
12:10
Cause I think that she just hasn't seen me in the right light.
12:12
(Laughter)
12:13
Maybe, that's not the wrong shirt on.
12:15
Right?
12:15
Cause I'm interpreting that the way I want to interpret it.
12:18
Finally I asked her out again.
12:20
She gave me this one comment, right? Or, she sent it to her friend.
12:23
Cause that's the way you did it back then.
12:25
"She wouldn't date you unless
12:27
there was the last person on Earth,
12:28
hell was freezing over,
12:30
there was a small chance we had to save the planet Earth.
12:32
Some people, it's like, there's no chance.
12:34
I'm like: "You're saying there's a chance."
12:36
(Laughter)
12:38
Right?
12:39
Because that's how I'm gonna interpret it.
12:42
If I could give you one thing to take from this,
12:45
it is: no one will believe in you
12:48
unless you do.
12:49
Listen to the words of that video,
12:51
here's to the crazy ones,
12:53
the misfits, the rebels,
12:55
the troublemakers,
12:57
the round pegs in the square holes.
13:00
We're supposed to be different, folks.
13:03
And when people look at us,
13:05
believe in yourself.
13:07
Thank you.
13:08
(Applause)
