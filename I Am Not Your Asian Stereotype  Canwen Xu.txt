My name is Canwen, and I play both the piano and the violin.
00:09
I aspire to some day be a doctor, and my favorite subject is calculus.
00:15
My mom and dad are tiger parents,
00:17
who won't let me go to sleepovers,
00:19
but they make up for it by serving my favorite meal every single day.
00:24
Rice.
00:26
And I'm a really bad driver.
00:31
So my question for you now is,
00:33
"How long did it take you to figure out I was joking?"
00:36
(Laughter)
00:38
As you've probably guessed, today I am going to talk about race
00:41
and I'll start off by sharing with you my story
00:44
of growing up Asian-American.
00:47
I moved to the United States when I was two years old,
00:50
so almost my entire life has been a blend of two cultures.
00:54
I eat pasta with chopsticks.
00:56
I'm addicted to orange chicken, and my childhood hero was Yao Ming.
01:01
But having grown up in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Idaho,
01:04
all states with incredible little racial diversity,
01:08
it was difficult to reconcile my so-called exotic Chinese heritage
01:12
with my mainstream American self.
01:15
Used to being the only Asian in the room,
01:18
I was self-conscious at the first thing people noticed about me
01:21
was, that I wasn't white.
01:23
And as a child I quickly began to realize
01:26
that I had two options in front of me.
01:28
Conformed to the stereotype that was expected of me,
01:31
or conformed to the whiteness that surrounded me.
01:35
There was no in between.
01:38
For me, this meant that I always felt self-conscious about being good at maths,
01:42
because people would just say it was because I was Asian,
01:45
not because I actually worked hard.
01:47
It meant that whenever a boy asked me out,
01:50
it was because he had the yellow fever,
01:52
and not because he actually liked me.
01:55
It meant that for the longest time
01:57
my identity had formed around the fact that I was different.
02:01
And I thought that being Asian was the only special thing about me.
02:06
These effects were emphasized by the places where I lived.
02:09
Don't get me wrong.
02:10
Only a small percentage of people were actually racist,
02:13
or, even borderline racist,
02:15
but the vast majority were just a little bit clueless.
02:20
Now, I know you are probably thinking, "What's the difference?"
02:23
Well, here is an example.
02:25
Not racist can sound like, "I'm white and you're not."
02:30
Racist can sound like,
02:31
"I'm white, you're not, and that makes me better than you."
02:36
But clueless sounds like,
02:38
"I'm white, you're not, and I don't know how to deal with that."
02:43
Now, I don't doubt for a second
02:45
that these clueless people are still nice individuals
02:48
with great intentions.
02:49
But they do ask some questions that become pretty annoying after a while.
02:55
Here are a few examples.
02:57
"You're Chinese, oh my goodness, I have a Chinese friend, do you know him?"
03:01
(Laughter)
03:05
"No.
03:06
I don't know him.
03:08
Because contrary to your unrealistic expectations,
03:12
I do not know every single one of the 1.35 billion Chinese people
03:16
who live on Planet Earth."
03:20
People also tend to ask,
03:21
"Where does your name come from?",
03:23
and I really don't know how to answer that,
03:26
so I usually stick with the truth.
03:28
"My parents gave it to me.
03:30
Where does your name come from?"
03:32
(Laughter)
03:35
Don't even get me started
03:36
on how many times people have confused me with a different Asian person.
03:42
One time someone came up to me and said,
03:44
"Angie, I love your art work!"
03:46
And I was super confused,
03:48
so I just thanked them and walked away.
03:52
But, out of all the questions
03:54
my favorite one is still the classic, "Where are you from?",
03:58
because I've lived in quite a few places,
04:00
so this is how the conversation usually goes.
04:04
"Where are you from?"
04:05
"Oh, I am from Boise, Idaho."
04:08
"I see, but where are you really from?"
04:12
"I mean, I lived in South Dakota for a while."
04:15
"Okay, what about before that?"
04:17
"I mean, I lived in North Dakota."
04:20
"Okay, I'm just going to cut straight to the chase here,
04:23
I guess what I'm saying is,
04:24
have you ever lived anywhere far away from here,
04:27
where people talk a little differently?"
04:30
"Oh, I know where you talking about, yes I have, I used to live in Texas."
04:34
(Laughter)
04:38
By then, they usually have just given up and wonder to themselves
04:41
why I'm not one of the cool Asians like Jeremy Lin or Jackie Chan,
04:44
or they skip the needless banter and go straight for the,
04:48
"Where is your family from?"
04:49
So, just an FYI for all of you out there, that is the safest strategy.
04:55
But, as amusing as these interactions were,
04:57
oftentimes they made me want to reject my own culture,
05:00
because I thought it helped me conform.
05:03
I distanced myself from the Asian stereotype
05:06
as much as possible, by degrading my own race,
05:09
and pretending I hated math.
05:12
And the worse part was, it worked.
05:16
The more I rejected my Chinese identity, the more popular I became.
05:20
My peers liked me more, because I was more similar to them.
05:25
I became more confident, because I knew I was more similar to them.
05:31
But as I became more Americanized,
05:34
I also began to lose bits and pieces of myself,
05:36
parts of me that I can never get back,
05:38
and no matter how much I tried to pretend
05:41
that I was the same as my American classmates,
05:44
I wasn't.
05:46
Because for people who have lived in the places where I lived,
05:50
white is the norm, and for me, white became the norm too.
05:55
For my fourteenth birthday, I received the video game The Sims 3,
05:58
which lets you create your own characters and control their lives.
06:02
My fourteen-year-old self created the perfect little mainstream family,
06:06
complete with a huge mansion and an enormous swimming pool.
06:11
I binge-played the game for about three months,
06:13
then put it away and never really thought about it again,
06:15
until a few weeks ago,
06:17
when I came to a sudden realization.
06:20
The family, that I had custom-designed, was white.
06:23
The character that I had designed for myself, was white.
06:28
Everyone I had designed was white.
06:30
And the worst part was,
06:32
this was by no means a conscious decision that I had made.
06:36
Never once did I think to myself
06:38
that I could actually make the characters look like me.
06:42
Without even thinking, white had become my norm too.
06:48
The truth is,
06:49
Asian Americans play a strange role in the American melting pot.
06:54
We are the model minority.
06:57
Society uses our success to pit us against other people of color
07:01
as justification that racism doesn't exist.
07:05
But was does that mean for us, Asian Americans?
07:10
It means that we are not quite similar enough to be accepted,
07:13
but we aren't different enough to be loathed.
07:15
We are in a perpetually grey zone,
07:17
and society isn't quite sure what to do with us.
07:20
So they group us by the color of our skin.
07:23
They tell us that we must reject our own heritages,
07:26
so we can fit in with the crowd.
07:28
They tell us that our foreignness
07:30
is the only identifying characteristic of us.
07:34
They strip away our identities one by one,
07:36
until we are foreign, but not quite foreign,
07:39
American but not quite American,
07:42
individual,
07:43
but only when there are no other people from our native country around.
07:49
I wish that I had always had the courage to speak out about these issues.
07:55
But coming from one culture that avoids confrontation,
07:58
and another that is divided over race,
08:01
how do I overcome the pressure to keep the peace,
08:04
while also staying true to who I am?
08:07
And as much as I hate to admit it, often times I don't speak out,
08:11
because, if I do,
08:13
it's at the the risk of being told that I am too sensitive,
08:16
or that I get offended too easily,
08:18
or that it's just not worth it.
08:23
But I would point, are people willing to admit that?
08:26
Yes, race issues are controversial.
08:29
But that's precisely the reason why we need to talk about them.
08:35
I just turned eighteen,
08:36
and there are still so many things that I don't know about the world.
08:39
But what I do know is that it's hard to admit
08:42
that you might be part of the problem,
08:44
that, all of us might be part of the problem.
08:47
So, instead of giving you a step-by-step guide
08:49
on how to not be racist towards Asians,
08:52
I will let you decide what to take from this talk.
08:56
All I can do,
08:58
is share my story.
09:01
My name is Canwen, my favorite color is purple.
09:05
And I play the piano, but not so much the violin.
09:08
I have two incredibly supportive, hardworking parents,
09:11
and one very awesome ten-year-old brother.
09:15
I love calculus more than anything,
09:17
despise eating rice, and I'm a horrendous driver.
09:20
But most of all, I am proud of who I am.
09:25
A little bit American,
09:27
a little bit Chinese,
09:28
and a whole lot of both.
09:30
Thank you.
09:31
(Applause)
